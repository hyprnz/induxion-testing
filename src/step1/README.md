# Test what you change

Your customers could greatly benefit from enhancing the capabilities of the legacy calculator.

Currently the calculator processes a collection of dates to calculate a planned start date.

There is a new market segment which need a different algorithm to calculate the planned start date.

Our goal is to refactor the existing code to a point where it is clearer where the new algorithm can be introduced.

## Step one 

Look at the code and identify refactorings that make the code easier to read and understand.

Why is the legacy calculator doing too much?

What are some of the concerns that could be split out?

We spend 60-70% of our time as developers reading code, why is this code hard to read and understand?
