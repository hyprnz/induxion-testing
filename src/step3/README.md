# Test what you change

## Step three

Now we have an object which encapsulates the count logic which is easier to test.

We have been able to use dependency injection within the legacy calculator to control the creation 
of the object. This also allows us to use mocks within the legcy calculator to simplify testing.

Try and replicate the mock tests using a fake object instead. 

When would you use a fake vs. a mock as a test double?

Identify and implement some missing micro tests using either the fake or mock approach.
